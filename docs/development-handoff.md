# Development handoff

This is the resume point for the next Token Center development agent. Read
[Product requirements](product-requirements.md) first, then
[Architecture](architecture.md). Those documents preserve the agreed product
scope and rejected designs; this document preserves the implementation state and
remaining acceptance gates as of 2026-08-22.

## Repository and safety boundary

- Canonical repository: private `memeloop-online/memeloop-token-center` on
  GitHub.
- Default branch: `master`.
- Canonical remote `master` at convergence start:
  `bd9d2e251ece8bbe610998a3d7bb91752d30c84a`.
- Integration branch: `fix/completion-p0-p1` in
  `/home/token-center-dev/worktrees/completion-p0-p1`.
- GitHub Actions and GHCR are the only maintained release path. There is no
  Forgejo mirror, Forgejo Actions or Token Center Harbor publisher.
- Do not build on the Westlake physical root disk. Source, Cargo state, temporary
  files and build cache belong on the Longhorn-backed Coder workspace.
- Do not run Kubernetes, GitOps, data migration, storage cleanup, rollout or
  cluster validation from the product task. Delegate those operations to
  `codex://threads/01a00a1e-3a18-7b82-8a36-a663c0ab6adc` after recording target,
  impact, read-only baseline and rollback.
- CPA/API2 remains the production service. Do not change its traffic or perform
  a formal cutover until the user explicitly opens and approves a new migration
  window. API3 trial data is disposable.

No secret, client credential, service token or OAuth material belongs in this
document, commits, logs or test fixtures.

## Converged implementation commits

The following commits are the source changes that must remain in the integration
history:

| Commit | Purpose | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `62cab854d7636f1b542797bd97169531ceedc9e3` | Stream synchronous Codex Responses image response segments instead of retaining multiple 15 MiB copies. | Strict Clippy/check and targeted tests passed. Exact short memory harness passed: idle 30.797 MiB, image delta 65.074 MiB, image peak 95.871 MiB, 2/2 responses, 15,379,225 bytes each. |
| `37a50fe0d9a2709c036f02deea961bf2ebf0a9a3` | Source commit for bounded standard OpenAI Images `b64_json` parsing and segmented response/archive. | Format, all-target/all-feature check, 11/11 focused library tests and harness syntax passed. |
| `9eaf4af` | Cherry-pick of `37a50fe` onto the integration branch. | Tree verified identical to the source commit; full memory acceptance has not run. |

The short memory report for `62cab85` is available only as ephemeral Coder
evidence at `/tmp/mtc-memory-short-62cab85.json`; its key measurements are
recorded above so the handoff does not depend on that temporary file. The tested
release binary SHA-256 was recorded in that report. New acceptance evidence must
always record the exact source and complete binary/image digest.

## CI and verification state

GitHub Actions run `32579001708` tested `bd9d2e2`. Every gate except the memory
acceptance job passed. The failing workload was real: two concurrent synchronous
Responses-tool images produced a 152.504 MiB RSS delta against the 128 MiB limit.
Commit `62cab85` fixed that measured path in the short harness. Commit `9eaf4af`
then applied the analogous bounded design to standard OpenAI Images, but no full
CI run has tested either integration commit.

Do not infer release readiness from the targeted results. No new CI, image,
deployment, migration or browser dogfood was started during convergence.

## Known blocking implementation work

The current Responses image parser is not ready for release. It recursively
parses nested `RawValue` subtrees; at the maximum JSON depth a large leaf can be
rescanned repeatedly, turning a bounded 16 MiB body into approximately 2 GiB of
parser work. Replace it with a single-pass root `DeserializeSeed`/`Visitor`:

- process only the normative root `output` recursively and the typed root
  `usage`;
- skip unrelated root fields with `IgnoredAny`;
- keep malformed JSON mapped to `upstream_image_invalid_json` and semantic
  shape errors mapped to `upstream_image_invalid_payload`;
- preserve borrowed byte ranges, duplicate-image rejection, usage allowlisting,
  depth limits and the 16 MiB response bound.

Add a real exact-byte acceptance scenario for both synchronous image protocols.
The first HTTP response body, persisted archive object and same-idempotency replay
must be byte-for-byte equal, and `Content-Length` must equal the shared segment
length. Do not satisfy this only by concatenating segments twice in a unit test.

The standard OpenAI Images path also still needs the short and full concurrent
memory harness. Keep the 128 MiB limit; do not raise it to make the gate pass.

## Resume order

1. Implement the single-pass Responses parser and real archive/HTTP/replay
   exact-byte scenarios for Responses and standard Images.
2. Obtain an independent P0/P1 review of the parser, accounting, archive and
   idempotency changes.
3. With the repository's pinned Rust 1.95.0 toolchain, run local formatting,
   warnings-denied Clippy, all-target/all-feature tests, Rust Cucumber, web type
   checks/build, Cucumber.js browser tests and release packaging contracts.
4. Run the short concurrent memory harness for both image protocols. If it is
   green, use one full GitHub Actions run for the exact integration SHA.
5. Only after all gates are green, publish immutable GHCR digests and delegate
   API3 deployment plus trial import to the infrastructure task. Do not touch
   old CPA traffic.
6. Reconcile imported CPA/CPAMP accounts, subscriptions, legacy credential
   access, usage totals, request archives and unlinked-session counts. Dogfood
   operator and self-service flows in a real browser in Chinese/English and
   light/dark modes, including text and image billing.
7. Report the exact source/image digests, addresses, reconciliation counts and
   rollback evidence. Wait for explicit user approval before any final delta,
   write barrier, DNS/route change or production cutover.

## Worktree inventory at convergence start

- `/home/token-center-dev/worktrees/completion-p0-p1` — integration branch,
  `9eaf4af` before the documentation convergence commit.
- `/home/token-center-dev/worktrees/openai-b64-memory` — clean source branch at
  `37a50fe0d9a2709c036f02deea961bf2ebf0a9a3`.
- `/home/token-center-dev/worktrees/responses-parser-linear` — clean branch at
  `62cab854d7636f1b542797bd97169531ceedc9e3`; intentionally contains no parser
  fix yet.
- `/home/token-center-dev/worktrees/handoff-docs` — documentation convergence
  branch based on `62cab85`; its commit is cherry-picked onto the integration
  branch after validation.

Run `git worktree list --porcelain` and a status check in every worktree before
starting. Preserve unrelated user changes and do not delete worktrees as part of
handoff.

If implementation or an older document contradicts the product requirements,
treat it as a defect or explicitly revise the requirement through review. Do not
silently resurrect rejected features such as model-prefix routing, a CPA bridge,
credential-to-provider coupling, application download throttling or a Forgejo/
Harbor release path.
